@<b>Interpretations</b> (2008) is a collection of jazz standards. It was my first adventure as a solo artists, arranger and band leader. I went into this trying to come out with a "live" feeling CD. So there was no rehearsal for this session, other than 10 minutes before each take. There were also no overdubs of any kind. And all the percussion sounds on the Latin tunes where played by me live in the studio. At the end of the day, I wanted the band to sound exactly the same live as we did in the studio. I hope you my enjoy interpretations of these great jazz standards!!

<b>Production notes ...</b>
<p>
This CD was recorded in the basement of a house in Littleton, CO, using ProTools HD recording software. All of the tunes with the band were recorded on April 23rd, 2007, over the course of about 10 hours. Cherokee (drum solo) was recorded on the morning of April 25th.
All mixing and mastering took place over the summer of 2007, at <a href="http://www.drumoverdubs.com" target="_default">The Wrecking Room</a>, Lyons, CO. Artwork and CD design was done in December 2007.  All the work on this project, from recording to mixing to art design, was done using Macintosh computers.
<p>

<p>
<b>Dedication ...</b>
<p>
This CD is dedicated to my parents, Fredrick & Gloria Oldencott. April of 2007 was the beginning of a tough year for my family as my mother was recoverying from brain surgery. Every day leading up to the recording I was practicing 3 to 4 hours a day, waiting  for a phone call to hear how mom was doing. It was tough being so far away and I found my drumming became my own therapy. I like to think a lot of my love for my mom went into this recording. I am happy to report that a year later my mom is doing well and planning on being around for many more years, to hear me record many more CDs.I love you Mom!
<p>
To my "Pops", thanks for handing me that Clifford Brown / Max Roach record as a kid, and for giving me my love for jazz. There isn't enough space on this page to describe how fortunate I feel to have you as my father. I love you man!!
