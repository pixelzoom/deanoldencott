@Triathlon and fitness are a huge part of life, my drumming, and who I am! I
think being physically fit makes me a better drummer and teacher. Drumming
is very demanding on the body and I find when I don't exercise my playing
suffers. I don't think I will ever stop running, swimming, or biking as long
as I live.
<p>
In 2006, I did 5 triathlons and 2 half-marathons, and 2 trail running races.
I hope to better that in 2007 by adding some adventure races. I have
already run P.F. Chang's half-marathon in January and have started training
for this coming tri season.
