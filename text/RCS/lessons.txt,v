Please <a href="mailto:drumndino@@earthlink.net">e-mail me</a> with 
questions about available times and rates for lessons and clinics. 
My specialty is rudimental drumming and drumset (I'm a drumset guy), but I also teach basic mallets studies and all percussion intruments, including marching and concert percussion. From beginner to pro, I've got you covered!

<font color="red">NEW STUDIO LOCATION!</font>
<p>
In January 2011, I moved my teaching studio to a new location:
<p>
<b>Dean&#39;s Drums @@ Crossroads School of Music</b><br>
6949 Hwy. 73<br>
Evergreen, CO<br>
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6949+Hwy.+73,+Evergreen,+CO&sll=39.749814,-105.140439&sspn=1.140315,1.842957&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=6949+Hwy+73,+Evergreen,+Jefferson,+Colorado+80439&ll=39.589981,-105.310435&spn=0.008929,0.014398&z=16" target="_blank">click here for map</a>
<p>
This new location is in South Evergreen, approximatley 3.5 miles south of downtown Evergreen in the suburb of Marshdale :).  This new studio has more room than any previous studio I've been in, and the flexibility to teach on both acoustic drums and electronic drums. My studio is also connected to a Pro Tools recording studio, enabling me to teach studio drumming techniques. This is a rare thing to have access to as a student.
<p>

As always...Keep practicing !!!

I'll be teaching Monday through Thursday this semester, and I'm currently finalizing my schedule.
I have openings for only 6 new students!  If you're interested in lessons, please get in touch 
with me soon, as my schedule tends to fill up by mid-September.

I am currently teaching out of the Evergreen School of Music in Evergreen, CO. 
This is where I teach my private lessons, mostly specializing in rudimental 
drumming and drumset. I am a drumset guy, this is my specialty, but I also 
teach basic mallet studies and all percussion instruments, including Marching 
and concert percussion.

Starting in 2007, we are now reaching the end of my teaching semester, so I will 
not be accepting any more new students until September 2007. I am also going to shut 
down my studio a month early at the end of April, so I can go down to Texas and 
help out with some family matters. There will be no lessons at The Evergreen 
School of Music in the months of May, June, July, or August.

With that in mind, I am offering one "at home" lesson for each month of the 
summer if anyone is interested. I am busy playing a lot of gigs this summer 
but would be happy to work out something! Please e-mail me with any questions 
about Summer or Fall schedule. I will be completly full by the Fall, 
so get your time slot early, or you may be put on a waiting list.

Starting in 2007, I am teaching approximately 40 lessons a week. 
My schedule is almost completley full, and I won't be accepting any 
more new students until the fall of 2007. I do take June, July, and August 
off from teaching, as my performing schedule triples during the summer months.
