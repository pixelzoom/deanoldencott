Triathlon and fitness are a huge part of life, my drumming, and who I am. 
Being physically fit makes me a better drummer and teacher. 
Drumming is very physically demanding, and I find when I don't exercise my playing suffers. 
I don't think I'll ever stop running, swimming, biking (or drumming!) as long as I live.
<p>
In 2006, I did 5 triathlons and 2 half-marathons, and 2 trail running races.
<p>
In 2007 (so far) I've found myself playing more gigs than racing. 
But I've still managed some running races and one triathlon. 
I've been training, doing lots of mountain biking, and just enjoying the Colorado summer. 
I think I'm going to squeeze in a couple more triathlons now that things 
have slowed down a little.
<p>
Check back here soon! I'm putting together workouts for drummers 
(and other musicians) to help maintain healthy backs/hands/shoulders etc. 
Important stuff for all you working players!
<p>
And keep working out !!!!!!!!!!!!
