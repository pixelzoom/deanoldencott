<b>Interpretations</b> (2008) is a collection of jazz standards. It was my first adventure as a solo artists, arranger and band leader. I went into this trying to come out with a "live" feeling CD. So there was no rehearsal for this session, other than 10 minutes before each take. There were also no overdubs of any kind. And all the percussion sounds on the Latin tunes where played by me live in the studio. At the end of the day, I wanted the band to sound exactly the same live as we did in the studio. I hope you my enjoy interpretations of these great jazz standards!!
