My specialty is rudimental drumming and drumset (I'm a drumset guy), but I also teach basic mallets studies and all percussion intruments, including marching and concert percussion. From beginner to pro, I've got you covered! My studio is equipped to teach acoustic drums, hand percussion, mallet instruments (vibraphone, marimba) and orchestra bells.
