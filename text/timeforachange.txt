<b>Time For A Change</b> (2011) reflects so many aspects of my life right now,
it's really much more than an album title. It's really the "title track"
that I took from my youth and rearranged into the drummer that I am today.
This change also marks a time when I have dropped the "Matched Grip" and
gone back to the "Traditional Grip" - the way that I started out playing as 
a young drum student. It also marks a time when I'm not touring anymore,
playing a million gigs in too short a time. Instead I'm just enjoying life
as a teacher and mentor, living in the beautiful mountains of Colorado.
I hope you enjoy this time for a change.
